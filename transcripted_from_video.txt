Hi. My name is Mary Ann Gravois from Caldwell banker preferred in Bluebell, and I just listed 867 village circle in Bluebell, Pennsylvania. It sits on a corner lot about almost a half an acre, and it's got four bedrooms, two and a half baths. It has three fireplaces, beautiful corner lot, shrubs, and the landscaping is breathtaking. And I think you should come along and take a tour of this home, and you will see, your buyers will love it. It's in great condition. Thank you. Come on in and take your tour. Okay. That was awesome.
